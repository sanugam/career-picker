## Browser Verification Required

**Always verify changes in a browser after making any modifications to HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.**

### Verification Process

1. **After making changes**, open the modified file(s) in a web browser to visually confirm:
   - Layout and styling render correctly
   - Interactive elements function as expected
   - No visual regressions or broken functionality
   - Responsive design works across different viewport sizes

2. **For HTML/CSS changes specifically**:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser
   - Check that all styles apply correctly
   - Verify responsive behavior
   - Test interactive features

3. **Before considering a task complete**:
   - Confirm the changes work as intended in the browser
   - Report any visual or functional issues found during verification
   - If issues are found, fix them before marking the task as complete

### Why This Matters

- Visual changes can't be fully validated by code review alone
- Browser rendering may differ from expected behavior
- Early detection of issues prevents bugs from reaching production
- User experience is the ultimate measure of success

### Tools for Verification

- Open HTML files directly in a browser
- Use browser developer tools to inspect elements
- Test on different screen sizes using browser responsive design mode
- Check console for JavaScript errors

**Remember: If you can't verify in a browser yourself, inform the user that browser verification is needed and describe what should be checked.**
